# comp1406-tutorial-5
Some Java classes I wrote in my fifth COMP 1406 tutorial

The objectives for tutorial 5 were as follows:
 - Learn how to create a window with various components on it
 - Learn how to create a javafx.scene.layout.Pane and use it in more than one GUI
 - To become familiar with the javafx.scene.control.Button, javafx.scene.control.TextField, and javafx.scene.ListView classes
 - To become familiar with setting the location/dimension/colour/font of components
 - Practice writing event handlers
